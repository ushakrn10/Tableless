h1. Tableless

Tableless is a simple, almost trivial mixin, that will let you use ActiveRecord models without a corresponding database table

This will be useful for those of us who are not using Rails 3, but need the ActiveRecord validation functionality, would like to transparently use cool things like Formtastic.

Usage is simple. Firstly place tableless.rb in APP_DIR/lib, then:

<pre>
	class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
	  include Tableless

	  column :field_one, :string
	  column :field_two, :text
		column :field_three, :boolean
	end
	
</pre>
